## The Blog Has Arrived

After various delays and technical refactoring, the blog finally exists.  Probably should have done this sooner.  Writing makes my thoughts more clear, to me at least.  Tech can be a confusing landscape, keeping up with the new has left me little time to process my experiences and work.  Putting 'fingers-to-keys' makes it real.

Quarantine + a delayed job serach has forced my hand.  I can't sit on the zachdt.com domain for another week, I am finally bored enough.

Had a blast building this blog from the ground up using some of my favorite cloud tech.  [GCP Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run), which holds a special place in my heart as the first software launch I [attended](https://www.meetup.com/GDGCloudSF/events/261816691/) during my internship at Omni Labs, operates a fairly slim Node.js API handling blog posts requests.  Had a blast recounting that documentation.

React.js, CRA default, no class components. 

Going to be posting a series of write-ups on my previous experiences in software and product, just to get the writing juices flowing again.  Haven't quite set up a proper spellcheck pipeline for these .md files so bear with me.
