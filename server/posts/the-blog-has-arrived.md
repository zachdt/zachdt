## The Blog Has Arrived

After various delays and technical refactoring, the blog finally exists.  Probably should have done this sooner.  My work can be a confusing landscape, keeping up with the new has left me little time for me to process my experiences and work.  Putting 'fingers-to-keys' makes it real.

Quarantine & a delayed job serach has forced my hand.  I can't sit on the zachdt.com domain for another week, I am finally bored enough.

Server is Express, very vanilla.
Client is React, in all its hooky glory.

Going to be posting a series of write-ups on my previous experiences in software and product, just to get the writing juices flowing again.  Haven't quite set up a proper spellcheck pipeline for these .md files so bear with me.
