## Greetings and welcome to zach thielemann's github

My website should include all relevant links and contact info.
 
Moving to NYC in August 2020, looking for full time work as a Full Stack and/or Frontend SWE.  I have some PM experience, but due to the state of the economy most PM jobs will not be a good use of my time.  Contact me!
